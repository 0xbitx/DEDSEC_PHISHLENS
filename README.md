### DESCRIPTION
PhishLens is a powerful phishing detection tool designed to identify and analyze phishing websites. It combines multiple techniques, including domain reputation checks, SSL certificate validation, suspicious keyword detection, and AI-based phishing detection using a custom-trained dataset. Additionally, it can take screenshots of suspicious pages for further analysis.
Features

  * Domain Reputation Check: Analyze the reputation of a domain using VirusTotal or other APIs.
  
  * SSL Certificate Validation: Verify the validity of SSL/TLS certificates and check for expiration.
  
  * Suspicious Keyword Detection: Detect common phishing keywords in the URL or page content.
  
  * AI-Based Phishing Detection: Use a custom-trained machine learning model to predict phishing attempts.
  
  * Screenshot Capture: Take screenshots of suspicious pages for visual inspection.
  
## How It Works
  Domain Reputation Check:
        The tool queries VirusTotal or other APIs to check if the domain is flagged as malicious.

  SSL Certificate Validation:
        It verifies the SSL/TLS certificate and checks if it is valid or expired.

  Suspicious Keyword Detection:
        The tool scans the URL and page content for common phishing keywords.

  AI-Based Phishing Detection:
        A custom-trained machine learning model analyzes the URL and predicts whether it is a phishing page.
  
  Screenshot Capture:
        The tool captures a screenshot of the page for visual inspection.
